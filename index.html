        <p> I like to read fictional books, mystery books, and just some small books. I really like Sherlock Holmes, Harry Potter, Roald Dahl's collection, Charlotte's Web, and more. But my favorite book is Geronimo Stilton. I have almost all the books in the Fantasy series. Now, I have 12 Geronimo books. I just need the last and 13th book, then, my collection is complete! Thea Stilton is next in line to complete. I have finished reading all the Geronimo, Thea Stilton and Harry Potter books more than thrice. Currently, I am reading Sherlock Holmes and Charlotte's Web. So far, Charlotte's Web is proving to be good and Sherlock Holmes has approved itself to me and has become one of my favorite books. So, to further explain the books, I shall extend the explanation a bit more so you, dear reader, can understand why I like these books so much, not only that, why I like reading so much. And, at the end, I shall give you a sneak peak at one of my other favorite hobbies, just a little read. So, here goes. First, Geronimo Stilton, It is about a mouse who unwillingly goes on adventures becoming more highly known amongst the Fantasy population each time. Thea Stilton, a mouse, younger sster of Geronimo, and she likes to go on"fur-raising" adventures unlike her brother. She helps 5 young mouselets to solve mysteries as well. My little Pony is known very far and very wide for it's stuff, like merchandise, and toys and cartoons and BOOKS. The My little pony books are mainly stories of the animated catoon series. Harry Potter, is a very interesting magical book, loads of readers, including me, have been enchanted by this book. Thanka a lot to J.K Rowling(Joanne Rowling) for making up this appealing series of fabulous stories. Sherlock Holmes, it is usually for people above 11, but I have made a teensy execption. I had begun reading it at 9 and I learned proper English at 7 years of age. Sherlock Holmes is a series of Mystery novels which as exciting as they are good. Thank you Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Next up, Charlotte's web, a book about a little girl named Fern and her pig Wilbur along with his best friend, a spider with the name Charlotte. Charlotte's a clever spider who helps Wilbur in any way she can. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, a book consisting the most famous chocolatier in the world who gives out 5 gold tickets and the best behaved and disciplined child of the five gets a very special prize, The most famous chocolatier Mr Willy Wonka's colossal Chocolate Factory! Charlie and the great Glass Elevator just tells us that Willy Wonka and Charlie's family went to space, got younger, too much younger, older, too much older and that is the CRAZY Adventure. George's marvellous medicine, hmm...a boy who whips up a truly MARVELLOUS MEDICINE in order to cure his bitter grandma. Once he did that, he tries to make more of this magic drink but fails to get it right. In the end, his grandma shrunk down enough to never bother the family ANYMORE. The BFG, a book about a giant and a little girl who work together with the Queen of England to destroy the nasty giants. The fantastic Mr Fox is about how a clever fox dodges three revolting people to get food for his family and friends. Last but not least, the scariest, THE WITCHES!!!!A book about how a small boy who had heard tales of witches from his grandma arrives at a hotel where all the witches of England are gathered together to attend a meeting with the GRAND HIGH WITCH. In the end he and the other witches gets turned into a rat and the witches are gone.

            <p> And yes, I haven't forgotten, the sneak peak, The hobby I choose is.....CODING! I like coding because it's fun and easy and helps people, I want to learn coding so I can help others and make fun apps and games that keep people entertained. I am learing at Whitehat JR and I have a teacher named Irene Martina. Well, that's all for the sneak peak. See you readers next time, Goodbye!
